            <h2><b>Microsimulation of Gulshan 2 intersection with VISSIM</b></h2>
            <p><i>A study of the Gulshan 2 intersection located in Gulshan, Dhaka. I made some changes to the intersection 
            and compared it with the current operational layout by simulating them. This simulation was conducted on a 
            student version of PTV VISSIM. </i></p>

        <h3>Current Signal Timing</h3>    
            <p>Currently the intersection runs on a standard 4-phase signal system. The cycle 
            is about 280 seconds long. The green time allocation and the schematic diagram 
            of the traffic flow is given below:</p>
            <img src="images/fulls/Gulshan 2 Vissim/Default_Timing.jpg" alt="Project Image 1" style="max-width: 67%; height: auto; border: 1px solid rgb(204, 203, 203);"/>
            <img src="images/fulls/Gulshan 2 Vissim/4 phase.jpg" alt="Project Image 1" style="max-width: 31%; height: auto; border: 1px solid rgb(204, 203, 203);"/>
        </br></br>

        
        <h3>Other Parameters</h3>
            <p><span class="image left"><img src="images/fulls/Gulshan 2 Vissim/non-lane-based behavior.jpg" alt="" /></span><b>Non-Lane-Based Traffic: </b>The default driving behaviors in VISSIM strictly adheres to lane disciplines. But Dhaka’s traffic is nothing like that. Usually lane disciplines are not maintained. So, I adjusted the lateral movements to match the actual scenario. However, I do not have a proper way to validate this. So, the parameters were adjusted through trial and error, until the simulation appeared visually correct.</p>
            <p><b>Conflict Areas:</b> Conflict Areas were assigned as needed. Certain intersections and roundabouts might demand priority rules, but for a simple 4 phase signalized intersection Conflict Areas were enonugh. </p>
            <p><b>Performance metrics: </b>Queue counters were placed for recording maximum queue length generated for each run. </p>
        </br></br></br>
        
        <h3>Geometrical limitations</h3>
            <p> This intersection used to be a roundabout, which was later converted into a signalized intersection. 
            The remainder of the roundabout works like a pseudo sliplane now. 
            However, the traffic volume is quite high and as the legs get queued up, the left-turning vehicles cannot access it. 
            This issue requires serious landuse reshaping so, I've decided not to modify the sliplane designs.</p>
            <img src="images/fulls/Gulshan 2 Vissim/Queued slip lane.jpg" alt="Project Image 1" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border: 1px solid rgb(204, 203, 203);"/></br>
            <figcaption> Remnants of a roundabout can still be seen in the intersection. Since the storage lengths are too short and lane disciplines are not maintained, the left turning lanes are blocked most of the time.</figcaption>
        </br>
        
        <h2>Modifying the Intersection</h2>               
            <p>I copied the first model and converted the intersection into an 8-phase Ring and Barrier design with dedicated right turning lanes (Oncoming traffic are on the right in Dhaka). 
            It was made sure all parameters were the same for both models other than the signal timing and physical dissimilarities (right turn channelization).    
            </p>
            <p>This intersection experiences high traffic demands in some directions, while others having quite low. A Ring & Barrier design should provide more flexibility in green time allocation thus improving performance. Signal timing used for simulating the modified intersection is shown below.</p>

            <figcaption>A Ring & Barrier signal system requires 8 individual phases. The opposing phases on the diagram do not conflict with each other(e.g., phase 1 & 5, phase 2 & 6). This flexibilty lets us adjust the phase timing as needed, which in turn results in better performance.</figcaption>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>We can see that the approaches with the highest traffic volume (South leg and West leg) experience the most decrease in queue length. This is to be expected as having more phases gives more flexibility in adjusting green time for each direction while also reducing overall conflicts in traffic flow. However, the ring and barrier design increases the complexity of traffic operation. I designed this signal timing for the peak hour on a weekday. Realistically multiple timing schedules need to be assigned for the specific time of the day.</p>
        </br>
        
        <h2>Improvements in Simulation Model</h2>
            <p>This study is far from being perfect. Apart from the somewhat drastic changes I assumed on the infrastructure/ layout (e.g., turning 3 outgoing and 3 incoming lanes into 2 outgoing, 2 incoming and 2 dedicated right turning lanes), there are other shortcomings.</p>
            <p><b>3600s limitation on the student version of the software: </b>A big restriction of the student version is the 3600s time limit. Ideally, I would’ve liked to run the model for a couple of minutes to build up the traffic, before recording results. But since I’m only getting 3600s, I did not bother dividing that to get a warmup phase. All performance metrics were collected for 0-3600s of the simulation.</p>
            <p><b>Collection of proper field data for comparison and evaluation: </b>To improve the model performance field data such as Saturation Flow, Travel time, Vehicle Delay needs to be measured for the intersection and incorporated in the study.</p>
        </br>

        <h2>Application of M.L. for Model Calibration</h2>
            <p>This is the part I am excited about the most.</p>
            <p>Without proper calibration and validation, I cannot confirm how the results generated by my models will translate to real world scenarios. One such research that dives into the process of calibrating simulation models is <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266310289_Development_and_Evaluation_of_a_Procedure_for_the_Calibration_of_Simulation_Models"><i>“Development and Evaluation of a Procedure for the Calibration of Simulation Models”</i></a> by Prof. Brian Park and Hongtu Qi. They have used a machine learning technique, genetic algorithm to be specific, to calibrate and validate the model parameters so that their results match the real-world data. In future I would love to implement such Machine learning techniques into my own work.</p>
