        <h3>Signal Timing</h3>    
            <p>Currently the intersection runs on a standard 4-phase signal system. The cycle 
            is about 280 seconds long. The green time allocation and the schematic diagram 
            of the traffic flow is given below:</p>
            <img src="images/fulls/Gulshan 2 Vissim/Default_Timing.jpg" alt="Project Image 1" style="max-width: 67%; height: auto; border: 1px solid rgb(204, 203, 203);"/>

        </br></br>

        
        <h3>Other Parameters</h3>
            <p><span class="image left"><img src="images/fulls/Gulshan 2 Vissim/non-lane-based behavior.jpg" alt="" /></span><b>Non-Lane-Based Traffic: </b>The default driving behaviors in VISSIM strictly maintains lane disciplines. But Dhaka’s traffic is chaotic. So, I adjusted the lateral movements to match the actual scenario. However, I couldn't find a proper way to measure the movements. I adjusted the parameters through trial and error until the simulation looked visually correct.</p>
            <p><b>Conflict Areas:</b> Conflict Areas were assigned as needed. Certain intersections and roundabouts might demand priority rules, but for a simple 4 phase signalized intersection assigning the basic Conflict Areas were enonugh. </p>
            <p><b>Performance metrics: </b>Queue counters were placed for recording maximum queue length generated for each run. </p>
        </br></br></br>
        
        <h3>Geometrical limitations</h3>
            <p> This intersection used to be a roundabout, which was later converted into a signalized intersection. 
            The remainder of the roundabout works like a pseudo sliplane now. 
            When the traffic is high, the legs get queued up and the left-turning vehicles cannot access it anymore. 
            Addressing this issue requires landscape reshaping, which probably will never happen, so I've decided not to modify the sliplanes.</p>
            <img src="images/fulls/Gulshan 2 Vissim/Queued slip lane.jpg" alt="Project Image 1" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border: 1px solid rgb(204, 203, 203);"/></br>
            <figcaption> Remnants of a roundabout can still be seen in the intersection. Since the traffic is relatively high most of the time, storage lengths are too short and lane disciplines are not maintained, the left turning lanes are blocked most of the time.</figcaption>
        </br>
        
        <h2>Modifying the Intersection</h2>               
            <p>I converted the intersection into an 8-phase Ring and Barrier design with dedicated right turning lanes (Oncoming traffic are on the right in Dhaka). 
            It was made sure all parameters were the same for both models other than the signal timing and right turn channelization.    
            </p>
            <p>This intersection faces high traffic demand in some directions and comparatively low in others. A Ring & Barrier design should provide more flexibility in green time allocation thus improving performance. Signal timing used for simulating the modified intersection is shown below.</p>         
            <img src="images/fulls/Gulshan 2 Vissim/ring&Barrier2.jpg" alt="Project Image 1" style="max-width: 90%; display: flex; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/>    
            <img src="images/fulls/Gulshan 2 Vissim/8 Phase.jpg" alt="Project Image 1" style="max-width: 41%; height: auto; border: 1px solid rgb(204, 203, 203);"/>

            <figcaption>A Ring & Barrier signal system requires 8 individual phases. The opposing phases on the diagram do not conflict with each other (e.g., phase 1 & 5, phase 2 & 6). This flexibilty lets us adjust the phase timing as needed, which in turn results in better performance.</figcaption>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>We can see that the approaches with the highest traffic volume (South leg and West leg) experience the largest decrease in queue length. This is to be expected as having more phases gives more flexibility in adjusting green time for each direction while also reducing overall conflicts in traffic flow. However, the ring and barrier design increases the complexity of traffic operation. I designed this signal timing for the peak hour on a weekday. Realistically multiple timings might be needed for the specific times of the day.</p>
        </br>
        
        <h2>Improvements in Simulation Model</h2>
            <p>This study is far from being perfect. Apart from the drastic changes I assumed on the layout (e.g., turning 3 outgoing and 3 incoming lanes into 2 outgoing, 2 incoming and 2 dedicated right turning lanes), there are other shortcomings.</p>
            <p><b>Model Validation:</b> The model was not calibrated and validated against real world data. This is perhaps the biggest shortcoming of the simulation.</p>
            <p><b>Collection of proper field data for comparison and evaluation: </b>More field data such as Saturation Flow, Travel time ands Vehicle Delay needs to be measured for the intersection and incorporated in the study.</p>
            <p><b>3600s limitation on the student version of the software: </b>A big restriction of the student version is the 3600s time limit. Ideally, I would’ve liked to run the model for a couple of minutes to build up the traffic, before recording results. But since I’m only getting 3600s, I did not bother dividing that to get a warmup phase. All performance metrics were collected for 0-3600s of the simulation.</p>
            </br>

        <h2>Application of M.L. for Model Calibration</h2>
            <p>This is the part I am excited about the most.</p>
            <p>Without proper calibration and validation, I cannot confirm how the results generated by my models will translate to real world scenarios. One early research that dives into the process of calibrating simulation models is <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266310289_Development_and_Evaluation_of_a_Procedure_for_the_Calibration_of_Simulation_Models"><i>“Development and Evaluation of a Procedure for the Calibration of Simulation Models”</i></a> by Prof. Brian Park and Hongtu Qi. They have used a machine learning technique, genetic algorithm to be specific, to calibrate and validate the model parameters so that their results match the real-world data. In future I would love to implement this technique into my own work.</p>
